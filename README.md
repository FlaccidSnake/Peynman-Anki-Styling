# Peynman-Anki-Styling
The files for a standardised, good-looking Anki cards.
For noobs likeme: to use, paste all files in 'Anki2\Username\collection.media'.
><b>_peynmanstyle.css</b> is the card styling file.

Then, to use it, put ` @import url("_peynmanstyle.css");` in the styling section of your note template. You can then wrap elements with the Peynman styling classes.

To use any scripts, place the javascript files in the same directory as the styling file, and `<script src="_scriptname.js"></script>` at the bottom of your <b>html</b> on the front or back of your card template (whichever side you want to use the script)
